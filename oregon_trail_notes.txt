1. A difficulty system that allows the player to choose how much money they start with (banker, carpenter, or farmer)

2. In the beginning of the game, the player gets to name their five party members.

Resources:
- If you all your oxen die, you die
- If you run out of food, you start starving
- If you run out of clean water, you risk dysentery or cholera
- If you run out of spare parts, you can no longer repair your wagon
- If you run out of medical supplies, you can no longer treat illness

3. At the beginning of each day, you can choose to change your pace or not (steady, strenuous, grueling)
4. At the beginning of each day, you can choose your food rations (filling, meager, bare bones)
5. At the beginning of each day, you can choose to rest to attempt to restore health

- Stormy weather increases likelihood of drowning when crossing a river
- Oxen health is determined by grass abundance and pace

6. Sometimes you might encounter a river which has a random width and depth
When encountering a river, you can choose one of the following:
- ford the river (risks losing supplies, depends on river depth)
- attempt to float the wagon across (risks losing supplies, depends on river width)
- take a ferry (costs money)
- wait for conditions to improve

 7. Sometimes you may lose the trail and lose time
 8. You will rarely encounter a fort where you can buy supplies for a higher price
 9. Occasionally, a party member may get a snake bite, broken arm, measles, or some other sickness
10. Occasionally, your wagon breaks

- If you at low health, have inadequite nutrition, and your pace is too high or you haven't rested in a long time,
  then you will die of exhaustion

If you reach the end, you win (the number of points depends on how many party members survived and how much money you have remaining)
